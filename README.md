# KomputerStore

The project follows the guidelines provided in the Noroff assignment and includes the minimum requirements as described in the Appendix A-B.
The goal was to build a dynamic webpage using “vanilla” JavaScript, where users can buy computers using data from an API (https://hickory-quilled-actress.glitch.me/computers). To obtain enough funds for said laptops, users can either work or take out a loan from the bank.
